# Luigi pipeline management

As described in (the main pipeline documentation)[repositories_dependencies_and_pipeline.md], (luigi)[https://github.com/spotify/luigi/] is used to create and setup a blank `staging` schema and then to populate this `staging` schema from the `etl` schema.

## Basics of luigi

The (luigi documentation is robust)[https://luigi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/] and pretty complete. Luigi is setup around configuring `tasks` that have a number of properties. Each task is defined by making a class that inherits from the abstract `luigi.Task`, and further defines the things that need to be done before the task, the things that need to be done when the task is run, and the things that need to be true for the task to be considered finished successfully.

We use a number of custom classes from the (`pg_tools` package)[https://github.com/jonkeane/pg_tools]. This package defines a number of targets for postgress tables, columns, etc.

## basic `luigi.Task`

Every task should have three things (`output`, `requires`, and `run`), which are all defined as bound methods. These methods will be executed in this order, there the output is checked to see if the output already exists, the requires are run, and then the run method runs the task itself.

1. `def output(self)`  
  This should return a class that inherits from `luigi.target.Target` this class defines the check that is run to determine if the task has (already) completed successfully. This target can be anything from checking if a file exists or if a table in a postgres database is not empty. Most of our `output`s are custom types from `pg_tools`.

  *example* the following `output` will check if the table `schema_name.table_name` exists, if it does not exist luigi will run the `requires` and `run` methods.
  ```
  def output(self):
    return pg_tools.PGTableTarget(table_name, schema_name)
  ```  

1. `def requires(self)`  
  This returns (or yields, if there is more than one dependency) luigi task objects that should be completed before the current task is run.

  *example* the following `requires` will yield (and spawn) tasks to create a table for each `file` in the list `files` before the task it is part of is considered complete.
  ```
  def requires(self):
    for file in files:
      yield CreateTable(script=file, table=table_name, schema=schema.name)
  ```  

1. `def run(self)`  
  Finally, the `run` method is what needs to be executed for the task to run.

  *example* the following `run` will read in a script (`sql_script`) and execute it. This uses a `pg_tools` helper function `pgw.execute()` which executes a postgres query.
  ```
  def run(self):
    with open(sql_script, 'r') as myfile:
      sql_query=myfile.read()
      self.pgw.execute(sql_query)
  ```


## wrapper tasks `luigi.WrapperTask`

Wrapper tasks are like regular tasks, however they don't have a `output` or `run` method. Instead they only have a `requires` method. This `requires` should yield (a number of) luigi task objects.

## luigi parameters

Luigi accepts parameters that are passed to each task class. This are defined at the top level of the task class. These are helpful (and used in our code to) pass directories for files to parse, new schema names, etc.

```
class newTask(luigi.Task):
  param = luigi.Parameter(default="")
```
The code above will define a parameter `param` for the task `newTask`, which defaults to an empty string if not supplied.

## priority

Luigi allows for priority to be set for each task. Luigi will respect dependency order before it respects priority, but if a set of tasks are yielded in one wrapper task, priority can be used to make some of those tasks to be completed before others. This does not guarantee an execution order, but it will try (and if luigi is running on a single machine, on a single core, with a single worker it should guarantee the order). Higher numbers are higher priorities. If priority for a task needs to be set dynamically (that is, you are using an abstract class that is used to generate many similar tasks), you can use an `@property` decorator at the top of the class.

```
class CreateTable(pg_tools.PostgresTask):
  @property
  def priority(self):
      return(prioritize_tables(self.table))
```

The above code will call the function prioritize_tables which returns a number which is the priority that specific table creation should be given. This number is taken from a dictionary of table names mapped to priority numbers.

## Create `staging` and populate lookup tables

The luigi code to create the `staging` schema and populate all lookup tables is located at (`police-eis/schemas/setupStaging.py`)[../schemas/setupStaging.py].

Since the `PopulateLookupTables` task depends on the `CreateAllStagingTables` task, you only need to specify `PopulateLookupTables` and luigi will make sure all staging tables are created first.

### Parameters
The following parameters must be passed:

1. `--table-file ./populate_tables/lookup/lookup_tables.yaml`  
  This is the yaml file that contains the information to be placed into the lookup tables.
1. `--schema staging_dev`  
  This is the name that of the schema where the tables will be created (canonically `staging_dev`, but can be anything)
1. `--CreateAllStagingTables-create-tables-directory ./create_tables`  
  This is the directory that contains all of the create table SQL statement files that define the names, columns, and data types for each table to be created.

### Globals
The following global objects and functions are used:

1. `schema_in_file`  
  This is a string that is the schema that is specified throughout the create table scripts and populate lookup data. This is the string that is replaced by the schema specified in the `--schema` parameter.
1. `tabel_priorities`
  This is a dictionary that gives priorities for tables that must be created early in the process (due to foreign key constraints). The keys are the table names, and the values are integers, >1 where the larger the number the higher the priority given.
1. `prioritize_tables()`
  This is a function that takes a table name and returns a priority number based on the table_priorities

### Tasks

1. `CreateTable()`
  This task creates a table given a `script`, `table`(name), and `schema`. The task is considered complete if the table exists (which is determined by `pg_tools.PGTableTarget`). If the table doesn't exist the script is executed

1. `CreateAllStagingTables()`
  This task finds all of the create table sql scripts in the directory provided by the parameter `--CreateAllStagingTables-create-tables-directory`<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup>, and yields a new task for every create table script in that directory. This wrapper task is considered successfully completed when all of the tasks in its `requires` method have completed successfully.

1. `PopulateLookupTables()`
  This task populates the lookup tables. It requires that the `CreateAllStagingTables` task is complete before it runs. It then reads the data in the yaml file provided by the `--table-file` parameter, drops the information in those lookup tables, and then repopulates the lookup tables.

  Because this is a quick operation we have not yet defined an output target for this task that checks if it has already completed. This means that any time this task is run it will always repopulate the lookup tables.

## Populate `staging`



<hr/>
<b id="f1"><sup>1</sup></b> It should be noted that the parameter is passed on the command line with the task name prepended to the parameter name. So the `CreateAllStagingTables` task has a parameter `create_tables_directory` which is specified on the command line with `--CreateAllStagingTables-create-tables-directory [path to directory]`. Further, due to luigi limitations any underscores in parameter names must be replaced with dashes on the command line (that is, this parameter is refered to in the luigi script as `create_tables_directory` but on the command line as `create-tables-directory` ).
