# Managing staging schemas

The `staging` schema should not be in flux or have changes made on the fly. Instead a development schema (_eg_ `staging_dev`) should be used to test new population code. This allows the feature generation code and model code to rely on what is in the `staging` schema.

We use luigi to create and populate the `staging` schema. There is [detailed documentation on luigi and our setup.](luigi.md)

When the development staging schema is in a (reliable|stable) state, it should be moved to `staging` and then the development staging schema should be recreated (with the Luigi commands below).

You must have a credentials file called `luigi.cfg` for any of the luigi scripts to run. Because these luigi scripts are located in both the `police-eis` and `police-eis-private` repositories you will need two copies: one at `police-eis/schemas/luigi.cfg` and another at `police-eis-private/schemas/luigi.cfg`. The form of this credentials file is given in an example file `luigi_example.cfg`. Use the same format here, but with your credentials to allow luigi to connect to the postgres database.

## Repopulating staging_dev without touching staging

To drop and recreate the entire `staging_dev` schema only, run the following postgres commands:

```
DROP SCHEMA IF EXISTS staging_dev CASCADE;
CREATE SCHEMA staging_dev;
```

If you made edits to an existing table population script, and want to test it on this table alone, use:

```
TRUNCATE TABLE staging_dev.table_name;
```

to drop the values from just that table.

## Move staging_dev to staging

To move the `staging_dev` schema to `staging` issue the following postgres commands. It will also create a new, empty `staging_dev` schema that will then be populated in the next step.

```
DROP SCHEMA IF EXISTS staging CASCADE;
ALTER SCHEMA staging_dev RENAME TO staging;
CREATE SCHEMA staging_dev;
```

## Rerun luigi to create and populate the `staging_dev` schema

Run the following commands (in the `police-eis/schemas/` directory) to create the staging table structure and populate lookup tables. Before running Luigi, confirm that you have the correct credentials located in the file `police-eis/schemas/luigi.cfg ` an example of the format for the credentials are given in `luigi_example.cfg`.

```
PYTHONPATH='' luigi --module setupStaging PopulateLookupTables --table-file ./populate_tables/lookup/lookup_tables.yaml --schema staging_dev --CreateAllStagingTables-create-tables-directory ./create_tables  --local-scheduler
```

After the staging schema is created, run the following commands (in the `[police-eis/]police-eis-private/schemas/`<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup> directory) to insert the stored procedures and populate the tables with all available data. Before running Luigi, confirm that you have the correct credentials located in the file `[police-eis/]police-eis-private/schemas/luigi.cfg ` an example of the format for the credentials are given in `luigi_example.cfg`.

```
PYTHONPATH='' luigi --module populateStagingFromMNPD PopulateStoredProcedures --schema staging_dev --local-scheduler
PYTHONPATH='' luigi --module populateStagingFromMNPD PopulateAllStagingTables --schema staging_dev --populate-tables-directory ./populate_tables/mnpd --local-scheduler
```

## Population file locations and file names

Just like the create `.sql` statement files, the population `.sql` files are all stored in one directory and the structure of their filenames is critical. All population files should be stored in `[police-eis/]police-eis-private/schemas/populate_tables/[department]/`. Each `.sql` file should have the format `POPULATE-staging-[staging table name].sql` (eg `POPULATE-staging-arrests.sql` for the `staging.arrests` table). By default, the luigi command to populate tables will run each `.sql` file in this directory. Some tables need to be populated before others (eg `staging.officers_hub` must be populated before `staging.events_hub` because the `officer_id` column in `events_hub` is a foreign key to the `officer_id` column in the `officers_hub`).

### Table priorities
In order to ensure that luigi runs these tables in the right order, an entry should be added to the `table_priorities` dictionary in the `populateStagingFrom[department].py` luigi file. This is only necessary for tables that need a high priority (that is, needs to be populated first), the larger the number, the higher the priority and luigi will populate those tables first.

If any python based cleanup must be run after the data is populated, it should be in a file with the format `staging-[table name]-cleanup.py`, and an appropriate entry added to the `tables_and_cleanup_scripts` dictionary in the  
`populateStagingFrom[department].py` luigi file. This includes the table name that needs the cleanup run on it, and then a list with the location of the cleanup script, as well as the column that will be output to when the cleaning is done. Currently, the cleanup will only run if the column that the cleaned output to only contains `null` values.
