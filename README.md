This is a data-driven Early Intervention System (EIS) for police departments. The system uses a police department's data to predict which officers are likely to have an adverse interaction with the public. An adverse incident can be defined on a department by department basis, but typically includes unjustified uses of force, officer injuries, preventable accidents and sustained complaints. This is done such that additional training, counseling and other resources can be provided to the officer _before_ any adverse interactions occur.
